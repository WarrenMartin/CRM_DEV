To send data from a form to your in-house CRM, you can create a new route in your Express application that listens for a POST request from the form.
 Here's an example of how you can modify your existing code to handle a form submission:
Import the necessary middleware for handling form data:
javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

Add the body-parser middleware to your Express application:
javascript
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

Create a new route for handling form submissions:
javascript
app.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
  // Process the form data here
  // ...

  // Redirect the user to a success page or display a success message
  res.redirect('/success');
});

In your form, set the action attribute to the new route you created:
html
<form action="/submit-form" method="POST">
  <!-- Your form fields -->
</form>

Now, when the form is submitted, the data will be sent to your in-house CRM through the /submit-form route. You can process the form data in the route handler and then redirect the user to a success page or display a success message.
